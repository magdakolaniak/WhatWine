It is a different Brut Franciacorta because of its more intense floral and fruity notes which soften both its acidity and structure. The spicy and vegetable notes give way to the sweet ones and the result is an euphoric Franciacorta.",

    "description": "The red berry characteristics of the vinifera grape Cabernet Franc translate as an Icewine into strawberry like aromas and flavours. This Icewine is completely different from the white Icewines. The colour comes from pressing only as there is no skin contact during fermentation.  The earlier it is harvested, the darker the colour and the deeper the flavours.",

It is also what makes the wines expensive to begin with, it simply takes exponentially more work and more vines to squeeze out a bottle of wine.",

    "description": "Beautiful intensity of aroma with wonderfully concentrated fruit of cool stone fruit, apricot, fruit peel, a little wax and a hint of peppermint. The wine is wonderfully concentrated and has surprising freshness in the mouthfeel that creates ultimate joy. It feels almost like the wine is in the explosion stage with beautifully concentrated yellow tropical fruit, green fruit peel, nuts, spices and delicious salts. The balance between sweetness and acidity is fantastic and the acidity helps the wine to be experienced as playful and vibrant. A little closed at the finish shows that the wine will only continue its development to become an absolutely beautiful swan",

    "description": "The grapes are collected and quickly taken to the cellar where they are destemmed and delicately crushed to extract only the most noble and aromatic notes from the peel and the outer area of the berries. The must is immediately refrigerated and later it is partially fermented in autoclaves so that the carbon dioxide, which produces the lively bubbles, remains partially dissolved in the wine. Fermentation is then stopped by means of refrigeration, in order to leave a high sugar content. The beads are delicate and persistent. The color is light cherry red. The bouquet is intense and brings to mind musk, with distinct scents of blueberry and wild strawberry. The flavor is sweet, lively and reminiscent of the aromatic characteristics.",
